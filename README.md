# CAT-VTE_NSCLC
Metabolomic data of the study: Interaction between NSCLC cells, CD8+ T cells and immune checkpoint inhibitors potentiates coagulation and promotes metabolic remodeling- new cues on CAT-VTE.

# Abstract: Cancer-related thrombosis (CAT) and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are common cancer-related sequelae linked with high mortality, therefore finding predictive indicators is critical. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are utilized in cancer immunotherapy to activate T lymphocytes against cancer cells. Recent retrospective investigations found that some individuals experienced increased VTE after receiving ICI. We postulated that ICI (anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD1) effect on immunological and cancer cells, as well as their interaction, contributes for an elevated risk of CAT-VTE. Our objective is to investigate this molecular interaction in order to uncover potential prothrombotic indicators.
We pharmacologically modulated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in co-culture with CD8+ T lymphocytes (T CD8+) obtained from healthy blood donors. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) metabolic remodeling analysis revealed differences in extracellular metabolite concentrations after T CD8+ and ICI treatment.

# Material and Methods: Using Nivolumab (anti-PD1) and Ipilimumab (anti-CTLA4), we pharmacologically modulated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines in co-culture with CD8+ T lymphocytes (T CD8+) obtained from healthy blood donors. Two different modalities of co-cultures were established: direct and indirect (with T CD8+ separated from the cancer cells by a Boyden chamber with 1.0 μm pores).
1H-NMR spectroscopy was conducted to characterize the impact of the ICI in the metabolic profile of the immune and cancer cells, as well as the influence of immune cells in the cancer cells exometabolome. Therefore, the media obtained from the established cultures were centrifuged at 135 × g for 5 minutes and the supernatants were collected, stored at -80⁰C and later explored and defined by NMR. The supernatant samples were diluted in Milli-Q water to make up 540 μL (150 μL of water was added to 390 μL of supernatant). A volume of 30 µL of phosphate buffer was added to the samples along with 30 μL of a solution of 2.2 mM 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic 2,2,3,3-d4 acid (TSP) in D2O. TSP was used as an internal reference for quantification and chemical shift. 1H-NMR spectra were acquired in a magnetic field of 500 MHz in an UltrashiedTM 500 Plus spectrometer (Bruker) with a TCI-Z probe at Instituto de Tecnologia Química e Biológica da Universidade NOVA de Lisboa (ITQB-UNL), Oeiras. The spectra analysis was made in TopSpin 4.1 software, according to Chenomx NMR suite 8.11 and Human Metabolome Database (HMDB).
